  HOW TO MAKE AI TRUSTWORTHY
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
</strong>

  <p>
    In order to make AI trustworthy, it is good to follow some Guidelines.
    Trustworthy AI is based on three pillars that must be present throughout the
    system:
    <br />
    <br />
    - legal compliance, ensuring that AI complies with all laws and regulations
    in force;&nbsp;
    <br />
    - ethical integrity, ensuring compliance with the principles and moral
    values;
    <br />
    - robustness, both technically and socially, since, even with the best
    intentions, AI systems can cause unintentional harm.
    <br />
    <br />
    Each pillar, while essential, is not sufficient on its own to ensure trusted
    AI. Ideally, these three elements should interact in harmony and overlap;
    should practical tensions emerge between them, society should work to
    resolve them.

  SOME DETAILS
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
</strong>

  <p>    AI ethics constitutes a field of applied ethics dedicated to examining the
    ethical dilemmas arising from the design, deployment, and use of Artificial
    Intelligence. His main interest is understanding how AI can positively or
    negatively influence the happiness of individuals, both in terms of quality
    of life and freedom and autonomy fundamental to a democratic society.
    <br />
    <br />
    Thinking about the ethics of AI can be beneficial for several reasons. First
    of all, it can encourage the protection of individuals and groups at a basic
    level. Secondly, it can foster ethical value-driven innovation, such as
    those contributing to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development
    Goals, which form an integral part of the EU's 2030 Agenda. Although this
    document focuses primarily on the first objective mentioned, the importance
    that ethics can have for the second should not be underestimated.
    <br />
    <br />
    Trustworthy AI can improve individual and collective well-being, generating
    wealth, creating value and maximizing well-being. It can contribute to
    building an equitable society, promoting the health and well-being of
    citizens in ways that promote equality in economic, social and political
    opportunity.
    <br />
    <br />
    It is therefore crucial to understand how to support the development,
    deployment and use of AI in the best possible way, in order to ensure that
    everyone can thrive in a world where AI is widespread and to build a better
    future while maintaining competitiveness global. The use of AI systems in
    our society, as with any advanced technology, presents several ethical
    issues, including their impact on people and society, on decisions made and
    on safety. If we rely more and more on AI systems or delegate decisions to
    them, it is essential to ensure, through adequate accountability processes,
    that the effects of such systems on people's lives are fair, respect
    fundamental values ​​and act accordingly.
    <br />
    <br />
    Although an industry-specific code of ethics, no matter how well developed
    and updated, can never be a complete replacement for the ethical reasoning
    process itself. The latter must always remain attentive to contextual
    details that cannot be fully included in general guidelines. In addition to
    developing a set of standards, it is crucial to promote and maintain an
    ethical culture and mindset through public involvement, education and
    hands-on learning.
    <br />
    <br />
    We have faith in an approach to AI ethics that is based on the fundamental
    rights established by the treaties of the European Union, the Charter of
    Fundamental Rights of the European Union and international human rights law.
    Respect for these rights, in the context of democracy and the rule of law,
    constitutes the strongest basis for identifying abstract ethical principles
    and values ​​that can be applied in AI systems.
    <br />
    <br />
    These fundamental rights find a common denominator in respect for human
    dignity, thus embodying what we define as an "anthropocentric approach". In
    this approach, the human being holds a unique and inalienable moral status,
    being at the center of civil, political, economic and social issues.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    The Fundamental rights as a basis for Trustworthy AI are the following ones:
    <br />
    <br />- Respect for human dignity;
    <br />- Freedom of the individual;
    <br />- Respect for democracy, justice and the rule of law;
    <br />- Equality, non-discrimination and solidarity;
    <br />- Citizens’ rights.
    <br />
    <br />
    Between these principles there might be tensions and there is no default
    solution to resolve them. Addressing such tensions requires adopting methods
    of responsible discussion, consistent with the European Union's fundamental
    commitment to democratic participation, fair trial and open political
    participation.
    <br />
    <br />
    For example, in various fields of application, the principle of harm
    prevention may conflict with the principle of human autonomy. Consider the
    example of using AI systems in “predictive policing,” which could help
    reduce crime but could also compromise individual freedom and privacy due to
    surveillance. However, the overall benefits of AI systems are expected to
    significantly outweigh the foreseeable individual risks.
    <br />
    <br />
    Although these principles point the direction towards possible solutions,
    they remain abstract ethical concepts. It cannot therefore be assumed that
    AI operators will find the right solution based on these principles alone;
    however, they must address ethical dilemmas and trade-offs through rational
    reflection based on evidence rather than intuition or random decisions.
    <br />
    <br />
    In some situations, it may not be possible to identify ethically acceptable
    compromises. Some fundamental rights and related principles are absolute and
    intransigent, such as human dignity.

  THE PILLAR PRINCIPLES
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
</strong>

<strong style={{ display: 'block', width: '100%', textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '20px' }}>
  
  EXPLAINABILITY
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
</strong>
  
  <p>    Explainability is essential to instilling trust in users of AI systems. This
    principle implies that processes must be clear, the functionality and goals
    of AI systems must be openly communicated, and decisions must be explainable
    to the extent possible. Without such information, a decision cannot be
    adequately challenged. However, there are cases where it is not possible to
    fully explain why a model produced a specific outcome or decision, and this
    is known as the "black box" problem. In such situations, further actions may
    be required to ensure clarity (such as the ability to track, verify and
    openly communicate system capabilities), while still ensuring respect for
    fundamental rights. The amount of transparency needed depends mainly on the
    context and the severity of the consequences if the result is wrong or
    imprecise.
    <br />
    <br />
    This requirement involves the transparency of the elements relevant to an
    artificial intelligence system: the data, the system itself and the business
    models associated with it.
    <br />
    <br />
    Explainability concerns the ability to describe both the technical processes
    of an AI system and the human decisions related to it, such as application
    areas. To ensure that an AI system is technically explicable, humans must be
    able to understand and monitor the decisions made by the system. You may
    need to find a balance between improving the explainability of a system
    (even at the cost of accuracy) and increasing accuracy (at the expense of
    explainability).
    <br />
    <br />
    When an AI system has a significant impact on people's lives, it should
    always be possible to request an adequate explanation of the system's
    decision-making process. This explanation should be timely and tailored to
    the expertise of the stakeholder involved, who could be a non-expert, a
    regulator or a researcher. Guidance should be provided on how an AI system
    influences and shapes organizational decision-making, on the design choices
    of the system and on the logic behind its deployment, thus ensuring the
    transparency of the business model.
    <br />
    <br />
    Examples of Explainability:
    <br />- If an individual applies for a bank loan and is denied by the
    algorithm, it is their right to know why;
    <br />- If an individual is excluded from a public housing selection program
    based on a prioritization algorithm, he or she has the right to understand
    the reasons for such exclusion and to have access to the information used to
    determine his or her eligibility;
    <br />- If a candidate is not selected for a job through an automated resume
    screening process, he or she has the right to request a detailed explanation
    of the reasons for the rejection and to have access to the metrics used to
    evaluate his or her suitability.

  FAIRNESS
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
</strong>

  <p>    To ensure the reliability of an AI system, it is essential to promote
    inclusion and diversity throughout its lifecycle. This involves not only
    involving all AI-influenced stakeholders in the process, but also ensuring
    equality of treatment and access through inclusive design, which is closely
    linked to the concept of equity.
    <br />
    <br />
    Data used to train and operate AI systems can be affected by historical
    bias, incompleteness, and mismanagement. If these distortions persist, they
    can lead to direct and indirect prejudice and discrimination, worsening the
    marginalization of certain groups or individuals. Furthermore, they can be
    exploited to practice unfair competition, such as the homogenization of
    prices through collusion or lack of transparency in the market. Identifiable
    and discriminatory biases should be removed, if possible, already at the
    data collection stage. The development of AI systems, such as the
    programming of algorithms, can also be affected by such biases. One solution
    could be to implement surveillance processes to transparently analyze and
    address system objectives, constraints, requirements and decisions.
    Furthermore, hiring staff from diverse backgrounds can ensure a variety of
    opinions and should be encouraged.
    <br />
    <br />
    Examples of Fairness:&nbsp;
    <br />- A system that must choose between a certain number of candidates to
    hire must regardless of skin color;
    <br />- A system for allocating medical resources in emergency situations
    should be based solely on the severity of the patient's condition and
    medical need, without taking into account factors such as social status or
    income;
    <br />- A scholarship distribution system should evaluate students' academic
    merit and financial need fairly, without discriminating based on religion,
    political orientation or other personal characteristics.

  SECURITY
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
</strong>

  <p>    A fundamental element to guarantee the reliability of artificial
    intelligence is its technical robustness, which is closely related to the
    principle of damage prevention. For AI systems to be robust, it is essential
    to develop them with a risk prevention approach so that they operate
    reliably as expected, minimizing unintended and unexpected harm and
    preventing unacceptable harm. This includes the ability to adapt to
    potential changes in their operating environment and to manage interactions
    with other agents (human and artificial) that may behave in contradictory
    ways.
    <br />
    <br />
    Furthermore, it is important to ensure the physical and mental integrity of
    human beings. Like all software systems, AI systems must be protected from
    vulnerabilities that expose them to attacks, such as hacking. Attacks can
    target the data (via data poisoning), the model (via information leak), or
    the underlying infrastructure, whether software or hardware. If an AI system
    is attacked, for example with deceptive inputs (adversarial attack), both
    the data and the behavior of the system can be compromised, leading to
    incorrect decisions or even physical damage.
    <br />
    <br />
    To consider AI systems safe, it is necessary to take into account possible
    unintended applications (such as dual-use applications) and potential abuse
    by malicious individuals, taking measures to prevent and mitigate them.
    <br />
    <br />
    Examples of Security:
    <br />- In a corporate context, modification and insertion attacks of false
    data must be prevented to prevent the behavior of the algorithm from being
    modified;
    <br />- In a financial risk identification application used by banking
    institutions, it is essential to avoid the inclusion of false or manipulated
    information to ensure the correctness of the assessments and prevent
    financial losses or regulatory violations;
    <br />- In a facial recognition system used for access control, it is
    essential to protect biometric data from manipulation or falsification to
    prevent the results of the checks from being altered.

        PRIVACY
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </strong>

      <p>Privacy, closely linked to the principle of harm prevention, is a
        fundamental right that is of particular importance in the context of
        artificial intelligence. To protect confidentiality, effective data
        governance is needed which includes managing the quality and integrity of
        the data used, its relevance to the sector in which the AI ​​systems will be
        deployed, access protocols and the ability to process the data in order to
        guarantee its confidentiality.
        <br />
        <br />
        AI systems must ensure data confidentiality and protection throughout the
        system lifecycle, including data initially provided by the user and data
        generated during interaction with the system. Recorded information about
        human behavior can allow AI systems to infer not only individual
        preferences, but also sensitive information such as sexual orientation, age,
        gender, and religious or political opinions. For people to have confidence
        in the management of their personal data, it is essential to ensure that
        such data is not used in a discriminatory or unlawful way.
        <br />
        <br />
        In every organization that handles personal data, protocols must be
        implemented that regulate access to such data. Such protocols should specify
        who can access the data and under what circumstances. Only qualified and
        authorized personnel, with the expertise and need to access personal data,
        should have such access.
        <br />
        <br />
        Examples of Privacy:
        <br />- In the medical field, preserving the confidentiality of a patient's
        medical record is of fundamental importance according to the GDPR;
        <br />- In a bank's electronic financial transaction filing system, it is essential to ensure the confidentiality of customer personal data and sensitive financial information to prevent fraud and privacy violations;
        <br />- In a legal practice management system, it is critical to maintain
        the confidentiality of client data and sensitive case information to ensure
        client trust and comply with privacy laws.
